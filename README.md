The Google Developer Group Buea ( GDG Buea ) is a #techosystem of electronic enthusiasts and technically-minded hobbyists which grooms hackers, entrepreneurs and researchers by creating an anti-authoritarian culture where Google's products are employed to solve local technical problems. Our services come in the form of seminars such as Hour Of Code for Secondary/High Schools, Google Summer Of Code Meet-Ups for University Students, Google Cloud Developers Challenge Code labs for freelance developers, Android & Polymer Hackathons, etc.

DEVELOPERS

Developers are individuals that have made substantial contributions (hundreds of lines of code) to the website project during the Hackweek of the Devfest Fako 2015 in November 2015. Participation and contributions are graciously appreciated and credited in following. The Game of Thrones character nick names are just for fun and general happiness.
