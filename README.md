The Google Developer Group Buea ( GDG Buea ) is a #techosystem of electronic enthusiasts and technically-minded hobbyists which grooms hackers, entrepreneurs and researchers by creating an anti-authoritarian culture where Google's products are employed to solve local technical problems. Our services come in the form of seminars such as Hour Of Code for Secondary/High Schools, Google Summer Of Code Meet-Ups for University Students, Google Cloud Developers Challenge Code labs for freelance developers, Android & Polymer Hackathons, etc.
